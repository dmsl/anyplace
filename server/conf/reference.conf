# Global object class
# ~~~~~
# Define the Global object class for this application.
# Default to Global in the root package.

# logger.xml: uses a logback configuration: http://logback.qos.ch/
# root:
logger.root=ERROR
# framework:
logger.play=INFO
# application:
logger.application=DEBUG


# Router
# ~~~~~
# Define the Router object to use for this application.
# This router will be looked up first when the application is starting up,
# so make sure this is the entry point.
# Furthermore, it's assumed your route file is named properly.
# So for an application router like `conf/my.application.Router`,
# you may need to define a router file `my.application.routes`.
# Default to Routes in the root package (and `conf/routes`)

# Database configuration
# ~~~~~
# You can declare as many datasources as you want.
# By convention, the default datasource is named `default`
#
# db.default.driver=org.h2.Driver
# db.default.url="jdbc:h2:mem:play"
# db.default.user=sa
# db.default.password=""
#
# You can expose this datasource via JNDI if needed (Useful for JPA)

# Evolutions
# ~~~~~
# You can disable evolutions if needed
